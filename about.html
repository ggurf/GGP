      <h2>Meet the Developer</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Gurf — a 17-year-old passionate about game development and digital creativity. I enjoy combining design and technology to bring ideas to life, whether that’s through 3D modelling, coding, or building interactive environments.
         I’ve been developing my skills using tools like Unreal Engine, SketchUp, Photoshop, and Visual Studio Code through my studies at TAFE and personal projects. I’m always looking to improve, try new tools, and push my creativity further.
          This portfolio is a place where I can share what I’ve made so far, and where I’m heading next.

          <h2>Why I Built This Portfolio</h2>
          <p>This portfolio started as a project for my TAFE studies, but I wanted it to be more than just an assignment. I saw it as a chance to create something useful that could represent my skills and growth as a developer.
             By building this site, I not only learned more about web development and design, but I also created a space to showcase my work in game development, 3D modelling, and coding.
              My goal is for this portfolio to grow with me and become something I can use for future opportunities — whether that's applying for jobs, internships, or sharing my projects with others.

          <h2>Extra Details</h2>
          <p>This website was built using HTML and CSS, and developed in Visual Studio Code. I used GitHub to manage and back up my code, which also allowed me to keep track of changes and version history throughout the project.
             To make sure the code followed best practices, I used W3Schools’ HTML and CSS validators to check for any errors or inconsistencies.
              I also ran the site through the WAVE accessibility tool to ensure it’s usable for a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.
             These tools helped me build a more reliable, accessible, and professional-looking portfolio that meets modern web standards.
